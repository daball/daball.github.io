In case you aren't familiar with it, [First Sentinel Bank](http://www.firstsentinelbank.com/) is a local bank in the southwestern Virginia region. As part of a larger project sold to, then Online Solution Pros (now no longer in business), I was hired in to construct one public page using ASP.NET. That page needed to display a table of current rates and easily permit the bank's site administration to edit these rates, add new ones, take some out, change product names, categorize rates by certain groups, etc. The contractor had a certain idea of how he wanted it, and I implemented it as requested. This project was completed in February 2005, and is still in use to this day with current rate information!
