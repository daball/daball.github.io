The core of our Spring 2011 ITEC 370 Software Engineering I course at Radford University was to collaborate on a group project that lasted throughout the semester. Our team, "Code Breakers," developed a fictitious company name, Custom Fit Coding, LLC, and developed a nutritional calculator application, to the client specification, in Java.

Our team included Stephanie Kinsella, Drew Salyer, Ryan Spoon, Steven Totten, and myself.

The project site, document cloud, and group message board are privately shared. The project source is available at GitHub.
