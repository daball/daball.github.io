Following up on my previous post, [Windows, Meet Linux. Linux, Meet RemoteApp](/2011/11/windows-meet-linux-linux-meet-remoteapp.html), I have moved that work into a Github repository for safe storage and easy installation. Be sure to read that article first to get an idea of what's going on. Then I wrote a couple of installation scripts that would help provision a RemoteApp Linux client even faster.

Read through the documentation in the README file and follow those instructions to enable RemoteApp easily.
