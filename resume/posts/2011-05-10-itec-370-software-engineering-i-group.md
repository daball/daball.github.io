The core of our Spring 2011 Software Engineering I course at Radford University was to collaborate on a group project that lasted throughout the semester. Our team, "Code Breakers," developed a fictitious company name, Custom Fit Coding, LLC, and developed a nutritional calculator application, to the client specification, in Java.
