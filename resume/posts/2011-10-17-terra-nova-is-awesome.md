I just watched one of the best TV shows I think I've seen in a long time. I didn't even know it existed, it's a new TV series called <a href="http://www.fox.com/terranova/" target="_blank">Terra Nova</a>. You can view the first three episodes for free at Fox.com and Hulu.com. I'll help you get started. Watch it, you'll love it! Way to go, Steven Spielberg! You've outdone yourself again!
